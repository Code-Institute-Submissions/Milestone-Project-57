##Who's That Pokémon

Website: https://amantamu.github.io/Milestone-Project-2/
This is web app game. When I was growing up I used to watch Pokémon everyday. In Pokémon series there used to be segment called who's that Pokémon before ads. And I could guess every Pokémon because it was one of the Pokémon of the episode. I made this game same as that , easy to guess and "Answer is always A".

##UX

The project design was simple. As I am only using first generation Pokémon and the color theme was 3 color Blue , Yellow and More Blue. There's more for user stories below:

• As a user type, I want it to look like Pokémon in 90s, I used color based on 90s which is blue, yellow, and more blue.
• As a user type, I wanted to have simple page and easy to navigate, so I put navigation bar on bottom and to 2 page only, One for play and another for information.
• As a user type, I wanted to use more colors because of Pokémon use a lots of color, due to hard to read and hard to look at, I used only 3 colors.

There are wireframes in image folder and you can see my prototypes and ideas to make this project come to life.

##Features

This is simple web app and the features are so simple but looks good.
##Existing Features

• Hover effects on links, options and navigation icons.
• Clicking on options button change color depending on which one. Option A is green and Option B is red.
• User will know the whether answer is right or wrong.

I wanted to have Pokémon list which is Pokedex. I wanted page to like a pop up page. I wanted to have animation in landing effects with sound, saying who's that Pokémon.

##Features Left to Implement

• I wanted 4 options which change their position randomly.
• I wanted to have color change depending on which type of Pokémon is.

##Technologies Used

• HTML : It is used for a structure of web page.
• CSS : It is used for a decoration of web page.
• Bootstrap : It is used for responsive layout of web page.
• JavaScript: It is used for API and some events and functions.

##Testing

All the testing is simple. Mostly is clicking options buttons and hovering to buttons and links. The social links opens to new tab. Buttons color change when hover and click. Website is responsive. It can be use in desktop or mobile app. Try refreshing page every time, it will always come a random Pokémon image and names. And clicking on play button and options, it will refresh the page or locate play.html website.

##Deployment

I used gitpod as code editor. I used gitpod to challenge myself to be similar and have more knowledge about it. It is not good as VS code but it very similar to VS code. Sometimes when I update something in my code and went to look at page update, it didn’t show. I realize that I have to ctrl + shift + r to reload properly.
I used github to deploy the website. Deploying or making live was very easy.
